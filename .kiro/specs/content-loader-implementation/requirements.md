# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The system needs a server-side ContentLoader class to handle content loading for AI-optimized API routes. Currently, multiple API routes are failing because they cannot resolve the `@/lib/content/ContentLoader` import. This ContentLoader should provide a unified interface for loading different types of content (blog posts, pages, services, solutions) with multi-language support and AI-optimized output formatting.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a server-side ContentLoader class so that API routes can load and serve content in a consistent manner.

#### Acceptance Criteria 1

1. WHEN an API route imports ContentLoader from '@/lib/content/ContentLoader' THEN the import SHALL resolve successfully
2. WHEN ContentLoader is instantiated THEN it SHALL provide methods for loading different content types
3. WHEN ContentLoader methods are called THEN they SHALL return properly formatted content objects

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an AI system, I want to receive content in a structured format so that I can process blog posts, pages, services, and solutions effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria 2

1. WHEN ContentLoader.loadContent() is called with content type 'blog' THEN it SHALL return blog post content with markdown, frontmatter, and metadata
2. WHEN ContentLoader.loadContent() is called with content type 'page' THEN it SHALL return page content in the same structured format
3. WHEN ContentLoader.loadContent() is called with content type 'service' THEN it SHALL return service content in the same structured format
4. WHEN ContentLoader.loadContent() is called with content type 'solution' THEN it SHALL return solution content in the same structured format

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a multilingual website, I want content loading to support multiple languages so that AI can serve localized content.

#### Acceptance Criteria 3

1. WHEN ContentLoader.loadContent() is called with a language parameter THEN it SHALL attempt to load content in that language
2. WHEN content is not available in the requested language THEN it SHALL fallback to English
3. WHEN ContentLoader.getAllEnglishSlugs() is called THEN it SHALL return all available content slugs for the specified content type
4. WHEN ContentLoader.getNativeSlug() is called THEN it SHALL return the localized slug for the given language

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an API consumer, I want consistent error handling so that failed content loading operations are handled gracefully.

#### Acceptance Criteria 4

1. WHEN content is not found THEN ContentLoader SHALL return null instead of throwing an error
2. WHEN an invalid content type is provided THEN ContentLoader SHALL return null
3. WHEN file system errors occur THEN ContentLoader SHALL log the error and return null
4. WHEN ContentLoader encounters malformed content THEN it SHALL log a warning and return null

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a performance-conscious system, I want content loading to be efficient so that API responses are fast.

#### Acceptance Criteria 5

1. WHEN ContentLoader loads content THEN it SHALL cache frequently accessed content in memory
2. WHEN the same content is requested multiple times THEN it SHALL return cached results
3. WHEN content files are modified THEN the cache SHALL be invalidated appropriately
4. WHEN ContentLoader initializes THEN it SHALL not preload all content unnecessarily
