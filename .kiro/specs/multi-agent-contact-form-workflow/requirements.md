# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines the requirements for implementing and testing a multi-agent AI orchestration workflow for the StateX contact form. The system should process user submissions containing text, voice messages, and files through multiple AI agents, analyze the content using real AI services (not mocks), and deliver comprehensive business offers to customers via Telegram channels.

The workflow integrates multiple AI frameworks (LangChain, CrewAI, LlamaIndex, AutoGen) and workflow engines (Airflow, Prefect, Dagster) to create a sophisticated multi-agent system that provides intelligent business analysis and recommendations.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Development Environment Setup

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to quickly set up the complete StateX development environment, so that I can test the contact form workflow with all services running locally.

4. WHEN I check service health THEN all infrastructure services (PostgreSQL, Redis, RabbitMQ, MinIO) SHALL be running
5. WHEN I check service health THEN all AI services (AI Orchestrator, NLP, ASR, Document AI, Free AI) SHALL be running
6. WHEN I check service health THEN the notification service SHALL be running and configured for Telegram
7. WHEN services fail to start THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and troubleshooting guidance

### Requirement 2: Multi-Agent AI Orchestration Framework

**User Story:** As a system architect, I want to implement a multi-agent orchestration framework using industry-standard tools, so that different AI agents can process user submissions in parallel and coordinate their results.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system receives a user submission THEN it SHALL route the request to the AI Orchestrator service
2. WHEN the AI Orchestrator processes a request THEN it SHALL distribute tasks to specialized AI agents based on content type

2. WHEN processing voice content THEN the system SHALL use free speech-to-text services or OpenAI Whisper with free tier limits
3. WHEN processing documents THEN the system SHALL use Tesseract OCR and Unstructured library for content extraction (both free)
4. WHEN local AI is available THEN the system SHALL use Ollama models for cost-free analysis and development
5. WHEN free API keys are configured THEN the system SHALL authenticate successfully with external AI services
6. WHEN API limits are reached THEN the system SHALL handle rate limiting gracefully and fallback to local models
7. WHEN AI services are unavailable THEN the system SHALL fallback to alternative free services or provide meaningful error messages
8. WHEN in development mode THEN the system SHALL log warnings if paid services are being used instead of free alternatives

2. WHEN I enter text description THEN the form SHALL accept detailed business requirements and project descriptions
3. WHEN I record voice messages THEN the form SHALL capture audio and prepare it for AI analysis
4. WHEN I upload files THEN the form SHALL accept documents, images, and other relevant business materials
5. WHEN I submit the form THEN the system SHALL validate all inputs and provide immediate feedback
6. WHEN form submission is successful THEN I SHALL receive confirmation that my request is being processed
7. WHEN form submission fails THEN I SHALL receive clear error messages and guidance for resolution

### Requirement 5: Multi-Agent Workflow Orchestration

**User Story:** As a workflow designer, I want to implement sophisticated agent coordination using proven orchestration frameworks, so that the system can handle complex business analysis workflows efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing agent coordination THEN the system SHALL use one or more of: LangChain, CrewAI, LlamaIndex, AutoGen
2. WHEN implementing workflow management THEN the system SHALL use one or more of: Airflow, Prefect, Dagster
3. WHEN agents are coordinated THEN they SHALL follow predefined workflows for different types of business requests
4. WHEN workflow steps execute THEN the system SHALL track progress and provide status updates
5. WHEN workflows complete THEN the system SHALL generate comprehensive business analysis reports
6. WHEN workflows encounter errors THEN the system SHALL implement retry logic and error recovery
7. WHEN multiple workflows run concurrently THEN the system SHALL manage resources efficiently

### Requirement 6: Business Analysis and Offer Generation
