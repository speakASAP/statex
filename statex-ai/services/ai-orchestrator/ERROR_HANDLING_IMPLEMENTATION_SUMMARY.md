- **RetryStrategy Enum**: 4 retry strategies (NO_RETRY, LINEAR_RETRY, EXPONENTIAL_BACKOFF, FIXED_INTERVAL)

#### Error Context and Classification
- **ErrorContext**: Dataclass containing submission_id, workflow_id, agent_type, task_id, service_url, operation, input_data, timestamp, attempt_number, and max_attempts

- **ErrorClassifier**: Static methods to classify errors based on exception type and context

#### Graceful Degradation
- **GracefulDegradation Class**: Handles service failures with intelligent fallbacks
- **Agent-Specific Fallbacks**:
  - **NLP Agent**: Basic text analysis with word count, keyword extraction, and simple business requirements identification

- **RESUME_FROM_LAST_SUCCESS**: Continue from last successful task
- **SKIP_FAILED_CONTINUE**: Skip failed tasks and continue
- **MANUAL_INTERVENTION**: Mark for manual review

#### Checkpoint System
- **CheckpointType Enum**: 5 checkpoint types (TASK_COMPLETION, AGENT_SUCCESS, WORKFLOW_PHASE, ERROR_RECOVERY, MANUAL_CHECKPOINT)
- **WorkflowCheckpoint Class**: Stores workflow state snapshots with metadata
- **Checkpoint Management**: Automatic checkpoint creation and cleanup

#### Recovery Manager
- **WorkflowRecoveryManager**: Coordinates workflow recovery operations
- **Auto-Recovery**: Automatically recovers interrupted workflows on startup
- **Recovery Status**: Provides detailed recovery options and status for each workflow

### 3. Enhanced Multi-Agent Integration

#### Agent Error Handling
- **NLP Agent**: Enhanced with error context and recovery mechanisms
- **ASR Agent**: Integrated error handling with fallback strategies
- **Document Agent**: Error-aware processing with graceful degradation

#### Workflow Integration
- **Multi-Agent Orchestrator**: Enhanced with comprehensive error handling
- **Checkpoint Creation**: Automatic checkpoints at workflow phases
- **Recovery Integration**: Seamless integration with recovery manager
- **Error Propagation**: Proper error handling throughout the workflow
