# StateX Development Management Script Enhancement Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive enhancement plan for the `dev-manage.sh` script to provide detailed status checking, port validation, endpoint testing, and optimized fast development startup for the StateX development environment.

## Current State Analysis

### Architecture Overview
- **Infrastructure Services** (Docker): 6 services (PostgreSQL, Redis, RabbitMQ, MinIO, Elasticsearch, Nginx)
- **Platform Services** (Volume mounts): 2 services (API Gateway, Platform Management)
- **AI Services** (Volume mounts): 8 services (orchestrator, NLP, ASR, document-ai, prototype-generator, template-repository, free-ai-service, ai-workers)
- **Website Services** (Volume mounts): 4 services (frontend, submission-service, user-portal, content-service)
- **Notification Service** (Volume mounts): 1 service
- **Monitoring Services** (Hybrid): 9 services (Prometheus, Grafana, Loki, Jaeger, AlertManager, Node Exporter, cAdvisor, Blackbox Exporter, custom monitoring, logging)

### Current Issues
1. **Limited Status Information**: Only shows basic container status, not detailed health checks
2. **No Port Checking**: Doesn't verify if ports are actually accessible
3. **No Endpoint Validation**: Doesn't check if service endpoints are responding
4. **Basic Health Check**: Simple curl to /health endpoints only
5. **No Service Dependencies**: Doesn't show which services depend on others
6. **No Detailed Error Reporting**: Limited information about what's failing

## Enhancement Goals

### Primary Objectives
1. **Comprehensive Status Display**: Show detailed status for all services with health indicators
2. **Port Accessibility Check**: Verify all required ports are open and accessible
3. **Endpoint Health Validation**: Test actual service endpoints, not just health endpoints
4. **Service Dependency Mapping**: Show which services depend on others
5. **Detailed Error Reporting**: Provide specific information about what's failing
6. **Fast Startup**: Optimize for fastest possible development startup
7. **Selective Service Management**: Start only services that are down

### Performance Targets
- **Startup Time**: Reduce from 2-3 minutes to 30-60 seconds for healthy services
- **Status Check**: Complete status check in 10-15 seconds
- **Error Resolution**: Provide specific solutions for 90% of common issues
- **Development Speed**: Enable instant feedback on service changes

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Status System

#### 1.1 Service Registry Configuration
**File**: `services-registry.conf`
```bash
# Service metadata structure
SERVICE_NAME|PORT|HEALTH_ENDPOINT|DEPENDENCIES|DOCKER_COMPOSE_FILE|CATEGORY|DESCRIPTION
```

**Services to Register**:
- Infrastructure: postgres, redis, rabbitmq, minio, elasticsearch, nginx
- Platform: api-gateway, platform-management
- AI: ai-orchestrator, nlp-service, asr-service, document-ai, prototype-generator, template-repository, free-ai-service, ai-workers
- Website: frontend, submission-service, user-portal, content-service
- Notification: notification-service
- Monitoring: prometheus, grafana, loki, jaeger, alertmanager, node-exporter, cadvisor, blackbox-exporter, statex-monitoring-service, logging-service

#### 1.2 Status Checking Functions
- `check_container_status()`: Get container state, health, and resource usage
- `check_port_accessibility()`: Verify port availability and conflicts
- `check_service_endpoint()`: Test actual service endpoints
- `check_service_dependencies()`: Verify dependent services are healthy

#### 1.3 Status Display System
- Color-coded status indicators (ðŸŸ¢ healthy, ðŸŸ¡ warning, ðŸ”´ error)
- Service dependency visualization
- Resource usage information (CPU, memory, network)
- Detailed health check results

### Phase 2: Port and Endpoint Validation

#### 2.1 Port Validation System
**Ports to Check**:
- Infrastructure: 5432 (PostgreSQL), 6379 (Redis), 5672/15672 (RabbitMQ), 9000/9001 (MinIO), 9200 (Elasticsearch), 80/443 (Nginx)
- Platform: 8000 (Platform Management), 8001 (API Gateway)
- AI: 8010-8017 (AI Services)
- Website: 3000 (Frontend), 8002 (Submission), 8006 (User Portal), 8009 (Content)
- Notification: 8005 (Notification Service)
- Monitoring: 9090 (Prometheus), 3002 (Grafana), 3100 (Loki), 16686 (Jaeger), 9093 (AlertManager), 9100 (Node Exporter), 8081 (cAdvisor), 9115 (Blackbox), 8007 (Monitoring), 8008 (Logging)

#### 2.2 Endpoint Health Validation
- Test actual service endpoints (not just /health)
- Validate API responses and status codes
- Test inter-service communication
- Verify database connectivity for each service

#### 2.3 Network Connectivity Testing
- Verify Docker network connectivity
- Test service-to-service communication
- Validate external access to all services

### Phase 3: Fast Startup Optimization

#### 3.1 Dependency Resolution
**Service Dependencies**:
- Infrastructure services must start first
- Platform services depend on infrastructure
- AI services depend on platform and infrastructure
- Website services depend on platform and infrastructure
- Notification service depends on platform and infrastructure
- Monitoring services can start in parallel with others

#### 3.2 Parallel Startup
- Start independent services in parallel
- Implement dependency-based startup ordering
- Add health monitoring during startup
- Skip healthy services to speed up startup

#### 3.3 Selective Service Management
- Only start services that are down or unhealthy
- Maintain service state cache
- Implement quick health checks
- Add service recovery mechanisms

### Phase 4: Enhanced Error Handling

#### 4.1 Error Collection System
- Gather detailed error information from all sources
- Collect container logs for failed services
- Analyze health check failures
- Identify port conflicts and network issues

#### 4.2 Troubleshooting Engine
- Provide specific solutions for common issues
- Generate recovery commands
- Offer configuration fixes
- Suggest dependency resolution

#### 4.3 Log Analysis
- Extract relevant information from service logs
- Identify common error patterns
- Provide log-based troubleshooting
- Create error trend analysis
