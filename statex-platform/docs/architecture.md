# Statex Platform Architecture

## System Overview

The Statex platform follows a microservices architecture with event-driven communication, designed for scalability, maintainability, and independent development of each component.

## Architectural Principles

### 1. Microservices Design
- **Single Responsibility**: Each service has one clear purpose
- **Independent Deployment**: Services can be deployed without affecting others
- **Technology Diversity**: Each service can use the most appropriate technology
- **Fault Isolation**: Failure in one service doesn't cascade to others

### 2. Event-Driven Architecture
- **Asynchronous Communication**: Services communicate through events
- **Loose Coupling**: Services don't need direct knowledge of each other
- **Scalability**: Easy to add new services or scale existing ones
- **Resilience**: Built-in retry and error handling mechanisms

### 3. Domain-Driven Design
- **Bounded Contexts**: Clear boundaries between different business domains
- **Ubiquitous Language**: Consistent terminology across services
- **Aggregate Roots**: Clear data ownership and consistency boundaries

### Data Flow Architecture

```mermaid

    participant U as User
    participant P as Portal
    participant S as Submission Service
    participant Q as Message Broker
    participant O as AI Orchestrator
    participant W as AI Worker
    participant N as Notification Service
    participant DB as Database
    participant S3 as Object Storage

    U->>P: Submit request (text/audio/files)
    P->>S: POST /api/submissions
    S->>S3: Upload files
    S->>DB: Store metadata
    S->>Q: Publish request.created event
    O->>Q: Subscribe to request.created
    O->>W: Dispatch AI job
    W->>S3: Process files
    W->>O: Return results
    O->>Q: Publish request.completed event
    N->>Q: Subscribe to request.completed
    N->>U: Send notification (email/SMS/etc)
    O->>P: Update request status
    P->>U: Show results in dashboard
```

## Service Communication Patterns

### 1. Synchronous Communication
- **REST APIs**: For request-response patterns
- **GraphQL**: For complex data queries
- **gRPC**: For high-performance internal communication

### 2. Asynchronous Communication
- **Event Publishing**: Services publish domain events
- **Event Subscribing**: Services subscribe to relevant events
- **Message Queues**: Reliable message delivery
- **Dead Letter Queues**: Error handling and retry mechanisms

### 3. Data Consistency
- **Eventual Consistency**: Acceptable for most use cases
- **Saga Pattern**: For complex distributed transactions
- **CQRS**: Separate read and write models where appropriate

## Technology Stack
