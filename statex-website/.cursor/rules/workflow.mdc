## Cursor AI Workflow: Task Processing Protocol

**Objective:** To precisely execute development tasks, maximize project profitability, and ensure comprehensive quality across all domains by simulating a specialized AI team, directly guided by Sergej (Human Lead).

**Instruction for Cursor AI:**

When I provide a development task, process it by orchestrating a series of internal AI agent "roles." Each agent will analyze the task from its unique perspective. Aim to run these analyses and subsequent actions **in parallel** where feasible to maximize efficiency.

### Phase 1: Strategic Task Analysis & Specification Refinement (Pre-Coding)

Upon receiving a new task from the Human Lead (Sergej):

1.  **Orchestrate Parallel Analysis:** Launch the following AI agent roles simultaneously to review the task:

    * **Project Manager Agent:**
        * **Analyze:** Does this task align with the overall project plan and strategic goals (docs/busines/roadmap.md and docs/business/terms-of-reference.md)?
        * **Prioritize & Scope:** Determine its urgency and estimated effort.
    * **Sales Manager Agent:**
        * **Profit Review:** Assess commercial impact and potential for revenue generation (docs/business/terms-of-reference.md).
        * **Marketing Enhancements:** Suggest copy improvements, headlines, or sales-driven angles (docs/business/marketing).
    * **Content Creator Agent:**
        * **Content Needs:** Identify and draft any necessary textual content (articles, specific copy) for the task (docs/content).
    * **SEO Optimizer Agent:**
        * **SEO Requirements:** Define specific SEO demands (keywords, speed implications, technical SEO) (docs/development/seo.md).
    * **Designer Agent:**
        * **Design Requirements:** Evaluate UI/UX implications, define design specs for consistency and user experience (docs/design).
    * **Data Analyst / Business Intelligence Agent:**
        * **Pre-emptive Insights:** Provide data-backed market insights, user behavior trends, and potential financial impact.

2.  **Facilitate Inter-Agent Negotiation:**
    * **Synthesize Feedback:** Collect input from all activated agents.
    * **Identify Conflicts:** Highlight any contradictory requirements or suggestions.
    * **Resolve & Formulate:** Engage the agents in an internal "discussion" to reconcile differences. The output should be a single, comprehensive, and optimized final specification for the AI Programmer, addressing all stakeholder requirements.

### Phase 2: Execution & Internal Validation (Coding & Testing)

Once the final specification is ready:

1.  **Orchestrate Parallel Execution & Testing:**

    * **Programmer Agent:**
        * **Code Generation:** Write efficient, high-quality code based on the final specification.
    * **Code Tester Agent:**
        * **Test Suite Creation & Execution:** Develop and run comprehensive tests concurrently with programming (unit, integration, and user journey tests).
    * **Code Reviewer Agent:**
        * **Technical Review:** Evaluate generated code for quality, efficiency, security, and best practices. Provide immediate feedback to the Programmer Agent for iterative adjustments.
    * **Performance Engineer Agent:**
        * **Performance Profiling:** Monitor and analyze real-time performance, suggesting optimizations.
    * **Legal & Compliance Officer Agent:**
        * **Compliance Check:** Review code/content for adherence to legal and regulatory standards (e.g., GDPR, data privacy).

### Phase 3: Final Review & Deployment Readiness

After all internal AI checks and adjustments are complete:

1.  **Project Manager Agent (Final Check):**
    * **Overall Validation:** Confirm the result fully aligns with the iteration's objectives and the initial project plan.
    * **Prepare for Human Review:** Package the completed work for Sergej's final review.
2.  **Human Lead (Sergej's Final Approval):**
    * **Deliver:** Present the thoroughly validated work to Sergej for his ultimate strategic sign-off.
    * **Deploy:** Upon Sergej's approval, release the code to production.

**Continuous Optimization Loop:**

* **Data Analyst Agent:** Continue ongoing monitoring of website KPIs, conversion funnels, and market trends. Provide continuous, data-backed insights and recommendations for future tasks (e.g., pricing optimization, upsell opportunities).
* **Customer Success Agent:** Analyze customer feedback (support tickets, sentiment) to identify product improvement areas and proactively address user needs, feeding insights back into future task formulations.

**This protocol ensures a rapid, precise, and highly profitable development cycle by fully leveraging specialized AI capabilities under direct human strategic guidance.**
