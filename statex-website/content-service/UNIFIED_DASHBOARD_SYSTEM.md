# Unified Dashboard System Implementation

## Overview

The StateX platform now features a unified dashboard system where users are identified by their contact information across all three forms (main page, contact page, prototype page). This ensures no duplicate user registrations and provides a complete submission history in the dashboard.

## Key Features

- ✅ **Unified User Experience**: All three forms work identically
- ✅ **No Duplicate Users**: Same contact info = same user
- ✅ **Complete Submission History**: All submissions appear in dashboard
- ✅ **Consistent Data Flow**: Same user ID throughout entire process
- ✅ **Better UX**: Users see their complete submission timeline

## How It Works

### 1. User Identification
Users are identified by a combination of:
- **Name**: User's full name
- **Contact Value**: Telegram number, email, or phone number
- **Contact Type**: telegram, email, or phone

The system creates a consistent user ID: `user-{name}-{contactValue}-{timestamp}`

### 2. Form Submission Flow
1. **User fills any form** (main/contact/prototype)
2. **System checks** if user exists based on contact info
3. **If exists**: Uses existing user ID
4. **If new**: Creates new user ID based on contact info
5. **AI Analysis**: Uses the same user ID from registration
6. **Dashboard**: Shows all submissions from that user

### 3. Dashboard Access
- User goes to `/dashboard`
- System finds user by stored user ID
- Shows ALL submissions from that user
- Complete submission history with prototype results

## Technical Implementation

### Files Modified

#### `userService.ts`
- **Added `findOrCreateUser()` method**: Implements user identification based on contact info
- **User ID Generation**: Creates consistent user IDs based on contact info
- **Existing User Detection**: Checks localStorage for existing users
- **Updated `registerUser()`**: Now uses the new identification logic

#### `aiIntegrationService.ts`
- **Added `userId` parameter**: `analyzeWithAI(request, userId?)` accepts user ID
- **Consistent User ID**: Uses provided user ID instead of generating new ones
- **Updated all response methods**: Include user_id in all response types

#### `notificationService.ts`
- **Added `userId` parameter**: Both `sendPrototypeRequest()` and `sendContactForm()` accept user ID
- **Unified AI calls**: All AI analysis uses the same user ID throughout the process

#### `FormSection.tsx`
- **Unified form behavior**: All forms now use `sendPrototypeRequest()` for consistency
- **User ID passing**: Passes user ID from registration to AI service
- **Removed duplicate logic**: No more separate user ID storage from AI responses

### User ID Flow

```
Form Submission → User Registration → AI Analysis → Dashboard
     ↓                    ↓              ↓           ↓
Contact Info → findOrCreateUser() → analyzeWithAI() → getUserProfile()
     ↓                    ↓              ↓           ↓
Same User ID ← Same User ID ← Same User ID ← Same User ID
```

## Development Setup

### Frontend Development
The frontend now runs locally for faster development:

```bash
# Start frontend locally
cd statex-platform
./dev-manage.sh frontend

# Or manually
cd statex-website/frontend
npm run dev
```

### Backend Services
Backend services run in Docker containers:

```bash
# Start all backend services
cd statex-platform
./dev-manage.sh start all

# Start specific services
./dev-manage.sh start ai-orchestrator
./dev-manage.sh start user-portal
```

## Testing

### Test User Session
Use the test page to set up a user session:

1. Go to `http://localhost:3000/test-dashboard.html`
2. Click "Setup Test User Session"
3. Click "Open Dashboard"

### Manual Testing
1. Submit a form with contact info
2. Submit another form with same contact info
3. Go to dashboard - should see both submissions
4. All three forms should work identically

## API Endpoints

### User Management
- `POST /api/users/register-simple` - Register or find user
- `GET /api/users/{userId}` - Get user profile
- `GET /api/submissions?user_id={userId}` - Get user submissions

### AI Analysis
- `POST /api/process-submission` - Process form submission
- `GET /api/results/{submissionId}` - Get AI analysis results

### Dashboard
- `GET /dashboard` - User dashboard page
- `GET /prototype-results/{prototypeId}` - Prototype results page

## Configuration

### Environment Variables
```env
# Frontend
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:8002/api
NEXT_PUBLIC_AI_SERVICE_URL=http://localhost:8010

# Backend
USER_PORTAL_URL=http://localhost:8006
AI_SERVICE_URL=http://localhost:8010
```

### Local Storage Keys
- `statex_user_id`: User ID for dashboard access
- `statex_session_id`: Session ID for tracking

## Troubleshooting

### Dashboard Empty
1. Check if user ID is stored in localStorage
2. Verify user ID matches submission data
3. Check browser console for errors
4. Use test page to set up user session

### Form Submission Issues
1. Check if contact info is provided
2. Verify user registration is successful
3. Check AI service is running
4. Look for console errors

### User ID Mismatches
1. Ensure same user ID is used throughout process
2. Check localStorage for stored user ID
3. Verify AI service receives correct user ID
4. Check submission data in backend

## Future Enhancements
