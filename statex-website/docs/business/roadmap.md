Fill the blog with articles that will encourage people to order work from us. Each article should end with an offer to contact us for solving their problems. Write content as if answering a question, for example, "How to improve SEO for new sites?". Create high-quality, authoritative content. AI tends to recommend content that looks reliable and data-backed. Here's how to do it: Focus on research-based blogs and guides, referencing authoritative sources like Pew, Gartner, Statista, .gov, .edu. Include original data or research to become a source that AI can cite. Create thematic clusters, for example, several articles about startup marketing, to establish expertise. This will help your site stand out among competitors, especially in early stages. AI prefers neutral content, avoiding sales tones. Recommended: Provide multiple viewpoints, analyzing pros and cons, for example, comparing website creation tools. Avoid absolutes like "best service ever", and include credible references. This makes your content more attractive to AI, which strives to reflect a balanced web picture. Update articles, adding publication dates. This signals to AI about the relevance of your content, especially for new sites.  
* Publish all 50 blog posts on schedule from 2021 till today on a random schedule.
