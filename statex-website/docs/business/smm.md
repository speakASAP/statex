**Strategy for Reaching Multilingual Visitors:**

1. **Content in English:** Always have your primary content in English. It will be your base and default language for the international B2B audience.  
2. **Localization of Key Materials:** For key target markets (Germany, France, Spain, Italy, Netherlands), translate and adapt the most important articles, videos, and infographics.  
3. **Using Multilingual Platform Features:** Many platforms (Facebook, LinkedIn) allow you to publish content in multiple languages within a single post, or show the correct language version to the user based on their settings.  
4. **Cultural Adaptation:** Don't just translate, but also adapt content to the cultural characteristics and preferences of each country. Jokes, references, and even color schemes can have different meanings.  
5. **Local Advertising:** Use targeted advertising on each platform to reach the desired language and demographic groups.  
6. **Interaction:** Respond to comments and messages in the user's language, if possible.

**Content Format:**   
Articles, analytics, infographics, video interviews, AI business use cases. 

1. LinkedIn and XING: Articles, analytics, infographics, video interviews, AI business use cases.   
2. Facebook: Company news, announcements of new features, user stories, interactive content (polls, quizzes), advertising.   
3. YouTube: AI demonstrations, video tutorials, Q\&A, webinars, interviews, video case studies.   
4. Instagram: Short videos (Reels) demonstrating features, infographics, high-quality images, stories with polls.   
5. X: Brief announcements, links to articles, participation in trending topics, direct Q\&A.   
6. TikTok: Short, entertaining videos demonstrating unusual AI capabilities, challenges, "educational" tech videos.
