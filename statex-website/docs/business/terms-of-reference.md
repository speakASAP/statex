AI services for business: We create services that help businesses implement AI, such as consulting or automation tools.

We can implement your task in real-time.   
Need to develop a system that will listen to voice messages from users, collect files they upload and text that the person writes in the text field.

The idea: *"show me the fast result"*. For this, visitors will only need to dictate their terms of reference, attach useful files with the terms of reference, dictate details with their voice, describe it in text and send them to us. The site should encourage the person to describe their situation in great detail and extract as much information as possible about what they need. We need to make sure that the person sends us as much information about themselves as possible.

To get results, they will have to enter and confirm a communication channel with themselves. Either this is a chat in some messenger, or this is email, but they must confirm it before they receive their result, which we will send them through this communication channel.

We will work on the solution and give them the first results (prototyping) for free almost in real time. We use AI to analyse requirements and propose solutions. Visitors can communicate with AI in chat and tune his requirements and improve the prototype online.

We will immediately send them a prototype of a ready-made solution already working, which will be hosted on our sandbox.

We will use our internal AI CRM powered by **Specialized AI agents** to track customers and provide them with best hints, solutions based on their concerns. Our AI agents handle everything from requirement analysis and solution architecture to customer success and business intelligence.

Indicate that support for all our solutions, including websites, is free in some simple cases. In case of regular changes on the site, the cost of support starts from 9.90 Euros per month.
