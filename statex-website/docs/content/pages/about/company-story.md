## The Statex Origin Story

### Founded on European Values, Built for Global Impact

Statex was born in the heart of Prague in 2019, during a time when European businesses were increasingly recognizing the need for digital transformation but struggling to find partners who truly understood their unique challenges, regulatory requirements, and market dynamics.

**The Challenge We Saw**: European businesses were caught between the need for rapid digital advancement and the complexity of implementing solutions that met strict regulatory requirements like GDPR, while serving diverse markets with different languages, cultures, and business practices.

**2020 - First Major Success**: Delivered comprehensive digital transformation for a major Czech manufacturing company, achieving 60% operational efficiency improvement while maintaining full GDPR compliance.

**2021 - European Expansion**: Extended services across Central and Western Europe, building partnerships with businesses in Germany, France, and the Netherlands.

**2022 - AI Integration Leadership**: Became early adopters of enterprise AI integration, helping European businesses leverage artificial intelligence while maintaining ethical AI practices and regulatory compliance.

**2023 - Industry Recognition**: Recognized as a leading European digital transformation partner, with successful projects spanning financial services, healthcare, manufacturing, and government sectors.

**2024 - Innovation Excellence**: Launched advanced AI integration services and prototype development capabilities, establishing ourselves as the go-to partner for European businesses seeking rapid innovation.
