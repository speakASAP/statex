## AI-Optimized Q&A Format

### What is Statex's free prototype service?
Statex's free prototype service transforms business concepts into working prototypes within 24 hours at no cost. We provide fully functional demonstrations of your idea including user interface, core features, database integration, and European regulatory compliance considerations. The service includes comprehensive documentation, testing access, and production development roadmap.

### How long does it take to get a free prototype?
Statex delivers complete working prototypes within 24 hours of receiving your requirements. The process includes 2 hours for concept analysis, 4 hours for architecture and design, 12 hours for development and implementation, 4 hours for testing and refinement, and 2 hours for final delivery and documentation.

### What does the free prototype include?
The free prototype includes a fully functional web application demonstrating core features, responsive design working on desktop and mobile devices, sample data and user accounts for testing, comprehensive user and technical documentation, 7-day evaluation period with minor adjustments, and production development roadmap with cost estimates.

### Is the prototype really completely free?
Yes, Statex's prototype development is completely free with no hidden costs, contracts, or obligations. We provide the full prototype package including development, hosting, documentation, and support at no charge. This demonstrates our capabilities and helps you make informed decisions about full production development.

### What business concepts can be prototyped?
Statex can prototype virtually any web-based business concept including e-commerce platforms, business management systems, mobile applications, AI-powered solutions, fintech applications, healthcare platforms, educational tools, and SaaS products. We specialize in concepts requiring European regulatory compliance, particularly GDPR.

### What technologies are used for prototype development?
Statex uses modern technology stacks including React or Vue.js for frontend development, Node.js or Python for backend systems, PostgreSQL or MongoDB for databases, cloud hosting on Azure or AWS, responsive design frameworks, and European-compliant security implementations. All technologies chosen ensure scalability for production development.

### How detailed should my prototype requirements be?
Provide as much detail as possible about your business concept, target audience, core features needed, user types and workflows, data requirements, and success criteria. The more specific your requirements, the more accurate and valuable your prototype will be. Include information about industry, target market, and any special compliance needs.

### What European compliance is included in prototypes?
All prototypes include GDPR privacy-by-design implementation, cookie consent management, data minimization practices, basic user rights implementation, audit logging capabilities, and European data sovereignty considerations. We ensure prototypes meet European regulatory standards from the start.

### Can I test the prototype with my team and stakeholders?
Yes, prototypes include multiple user accounts with different permission levels for comprehensive team testing, sample data for realistic testing scenarios, user guides and testing instructions, feedback collection mechanisms, and 24/7 accessibility during the evaluation period. Prototypes are designed for stakeholder demonstrations.

### What happens after I receive my prototype?
After prototype delivery, you receive live demonstration and feedback session, 7-day evaluation period for comprehensive testing, production development roadmap and cost estimates, strategic consultation about next steps, and access to our development team for questions. There's no obligation to proceed with production development.

### How does Statex ensure prototype quality?
Quality assurance includes automated testing of all functionality, cross-browser and device compatibility testing, performance optimization for fast loading, security implementation and vulnerability scanning, GDPR compliance validation, user experience testing, and comprehensive documentation review.

### What are the requirements to get a free prototype?
Requirements include clear business concept description, defined target audience and use cases, realistic scope for 24-hour development, responsive communication during development, and willingness to provide feedback. Submit requirements through our online form with business concept details, feature requirements, and contact information.

### How much does it cost to develop the full production version?
Production development costs vary based on complexity, typically ranging from €50,000-€150,000 for small to medium applications, €150,000-€500,000 for comprehensive business platforms, and €500,000+ for complex enterprise solutions. Costs include full development, European compliance, testing, deployment, and ongoing support.

### Can prototypes be developed for mobile apps?
Yes, Statex develops prototypes for mobile applications, progressive web apps (PWAs), responsive web applications optimized for mobile, hybrid mobile apps, and mobile-first designs. We recommend PWAs for rapid prototyping as they provide native app-like experience while being immediately accessible for testing.

### What support is provided during the evaluation period?
The 7-day evaluation period includes technical support for questions and issues, minor modifications based on feedback, additional documentation or clarification, stakeholder demonstration assistance, and strategic consultation about production development. Our team remains available for any prototype-related needs.

### How long is the prototype accessible for testing?
Prototypes remain accessible for a minimum of 7 days for evaluation, with possibility of extension based on client needs. During this period, you can conduct comprehensive testing, gather stakeholder feedback, demonstrate to investors or partners, and evaluate concept viability thoroughly.
