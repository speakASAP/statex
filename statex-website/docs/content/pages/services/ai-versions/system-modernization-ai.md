## What is system modernization and why do I need it?

System modernization transforms outdated IT infrastructure into modern, scalable solutions that drive business growth:

**Legacy Application Modernization**: Convert monolithic applications to microservices architecture for better maintenance and scalability
**Database Migration**: Upgrade to modern databases with improved performance and security
**Cloud Migration**: Move on-premises systems to scalable cloud environments
**API Integration**: Connect legacy systems with modern applications through robust APIs

Modernization typically results in 300-500% performance improvements and 40-60% cost reduction.

## How much does system modernization cost?

System modernization investment varies by complexity:

**Essential Modernization**: €25,000-€50,000
- Single system or application modernization
- Database migration and optimization
- Basic cloud migration services

**Comprehensive Modernization**: €50,000-€150,000
- Multiple system modernization and integration
- Advanced cloud architecture implementation
- Custom API development

**Enterprise Transformation**: €150,000+
- Complete IT infrastructure modernization
- Multi-platform integration and automation
- Advanced security and compliance

Most businesses achieve ROI within 12-18 months through reduced maintenance costs and improved efficiency.

## How long does legacy system modernization take?

Modernization timelines depend on system complexity:

- **Simple Applications**: 6-12 weeks for basic modernization
- **Enterprise Systems**: 6-18 months for comprehensive transformation
- **Database Migrations**: 4-8 weeks with zero downtime approaches
- **Cloud Migrations**: 8-16 weeks for complete infrastructure moves

Our phased approach delivers benefits throughout the process while maintaining business continuity.
