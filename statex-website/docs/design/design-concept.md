## Overall Visual Style:

**Modern, Clean, and Tech-Oriented.** The website will convey professionalism, innovation, and trustworthiness. It will avoid overly complex or cluttered designs, focusing on clear communication and a seamless user experience. The aesthetic will be sophisticated and forward-thinking, aligning with an IT company specializing in web programming and AI solutions.

## Color Palette:

The color palette must be color blind friendly.  
To achieve a modern and IT look, the color palette will primarily consist of:

- **Primary Colors:** They need to represent technology, reliability, and innovation. These colors will be used for main sections, headers, and prominent elements.  
- **Accent Colors:** They need to highlight calls to action, interactive elements, and key information, adding a touch of modernity and energy.  
- **Neutral Colors:** Clean whites, light grays, and dark grays (e.g., `#FFFFFF`, `#F0F0F0`, `#333333`) for backgrounds, text, and subtle design elements, ensuring readability and a spacious feel.

## Typography:

**Large, Easily Readable Fonts.** The primary font will be a modern, sans-serif typeface that is highly legible across all devices and screen sizes. Examples include:

- **Headings:** A bold, clean sans-serif font (e.g., Montserrat, Lato) for titles and headings to ensure strong visual impact and readability.  
- **Body Text:** A clear and comfortable-to-read sans-serif font (e.g., Open Sans, Roboto) for paragraphs and smaller text, maintaining legibility even at smaller sizes.

Font sizes will be generous, especially for headings, to align with the user's request for easy readable fonts.

## Layout and Structure:

**Clean, Intuitive, and Responsive.** The layout will prioritize user experience and ease of navigation. Key features include:

- **Hero Section:** A prominent and engaging hero section on the homepage with a clear value proposition, a strong call to action, and visually appealing imagery (potentially a subtle animation or video background).  
- **Modular Design:** Content will be organized into distinct, visually separated modules or sections, making it easy for users to scan and digest information. This will also facilitate the implementation of lazy loading for images.  
- **Responsive Design:** The website will be fully responsive, adapting seamlessly to various screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile) to ensure a consistent and optimal viewing experience across all devices. This will involve using flexible grids, fluid images, and media queries.  
- **Clear Navigation:** A simple and intuitive navigation menu will be present, allowing users to easily find information about services, company, blog, and contact details. Multilingual options will be clearly accessible.  
- **Whitespace:** Ample whitespace will be used to create a sense of openness, reduce visual clutter, and draw attention to key content elements.

## Visual Elements:

**Modern Imagery and Icons.** The visual elements will reinforce the tech-savvy and innovative image of Statex:

- **High-Quality Imagery:** Professional, modern images will be used throughout the site, depicting technology, teamwork, problem-solving, and successful outcomes. Images will be optimized for web (using `webp` and `aif` formats where appropriate) and implemented with lazy loading.
- **Abstract Shapes and Gradients:** Subtle use of abstract geometric shapes, lines, and gradients will add a dynamic and modern touch without being distracting. These can be used as background elements or overlays.  
- **Clean Icons:** A consistent set of modern, flat, or line-art icons will be used to visually represent services, features, and key information, enhancing scannability.  
- **Interactive Elements:** Subtle animations on hover, smooth transitions, and interactive elements (e.g., accordions for FAQ, interactive forms) will enhance user engagement.

## Usage Context and Technical Specifications:

- **Performance:** The website will be built for speed, use caching, utilizing optimized images, minified CSS and JavaScript, and efficient caching mechanisms. Nginx will be configured for optimal performance, including HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 support and gzip compression.
- **Progressive Web App:** Website will be built using PWA development.
- **SEO-Friendly:** The site structure, content, and technical implementation will be optimized for search engines, including semantic HTML5, structured data (Schema Markup for FAQ, Organization, Article, How-To), and mobile-first indexing considerations.  
- **AI-friendly:** Every page will have a link to markup description of what is there on the page. AI agents or search engines will follow the link and get information optimized for AI.  
- **Security:** Automatic SSL certificate generation will be implemented to ensure secure communication (HTTPS).  
- **Multilingual Support:** The website will support English (default), German, French, Italian, Spanish, Czech, Polish, Russian and Dutch languages for the EU market, also Arabic language for UEA market with an easily accessible language switcher.  
- **Call to Action (CTA):** A prominent and consistent CTA will be present on all relevant pages, guiding users to fill the form to get prototype or to contact Statex via phone, email, WhatsApp, or Telegram.  
- **AI Integration:** The design will accommodate the planned AI functionalities, including sections for voice message uploads, file attachments, and text input for technical specifications, leading to an AI prototype generation.  
- **Blogging Platform:** The blog will be designed to be visually appealing and easy to navigate, with clear article categorization and sharing options for social media automation.  
- **Logging System:** The design will implicitly support the logging requirements, ensuring that user interactions and data collection points are well-defined for backend implementation.
