## Migration Methodologies

### 6 Rs of Migration
1. **Rehost (Lift and Shift)**: Move applications without changes
2. **Replatform (Lift, Tinker, and Shift)**: Make minor optimizations during migration
3. **Repurchase (Drop and Shop)**: Replace with cloud-native alternatives
4. **Refactor (Re-architect)**: Redesign applications for cloud-native features
5. **Retire**: Decommission applications that are no longer needed
6. **Retain**: Keep applications on-premises when migration isn't beneficial

### Migration Phases
